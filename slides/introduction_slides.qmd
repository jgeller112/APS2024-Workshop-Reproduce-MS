## Packages

::: callout-important
-   You should also have Zotero installed (or some reference manager)

-   Along with the packages below
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(palmerpenguins)
library(quarto)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo:  true
#| 
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
# to uninstall TinyTeX, run tinytex::uninstall_tinytex() 
```

# The Problem

## Word issues

-   A .docx file is a compressed folder with lots of files
    -   Your text is buried in with a lot of formatting information

. . .

-   Not reproducible
    -   Code is divorced from writing
-   Difficult to maintain
    -   Errors!
-   What do I share?
    -   Lack of transparency

## What do we want?

-   Combine narrative with code

-   Automatically generate figures and tables

-   Automatically render results in text

-   Format the content into a scientific paper (including citations!)

-   Something that looks pretty!

-   Rinse & repeat

# Hello Quarto!

-   Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown

## Big universe

-   RMarkdown for EVERYONE

## What is a Quarto?

## Advantages

**(1) Eliminate human error in copying and pasting results**

*We found that half of all published psychology papers that use null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion* *([Nuijten et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2))*

## Advantages

**(2) Easy revisions and specification of desired figures and tables**

*When revisions are requested, one might have to tweak tables and figures by hand constantly, leading to a major incentive never to rerun analyses because it would mean re-pasting and re-illustrating all the numbers and figures in a paper.*

## Advantages

**(3) Promote computational reproducibility**

-   Easy verification and replication of research findings

-   While programming environments may seem counter-intuitive for writing papers, they ultimately prevent mistakes and save time.

# Let's Get Started!

## Getting started

-   Approach 1: Start from scratch (now)

    -   Creating a Quarto manuscript

        -   RStudio: New Project \> New Directory \> Quarto Manuscript

-   ::: callout-note
    Always start a new project folder!
    :::

-   Approach 2: Start with a sample template (later)

## Getting started

-   Let's go to RStudio!

## Output

## Anatomy of a Quarto Document {.scrollable}

## **Metadata & Header (YAML)**

``` yaml
---
format: html
---
```

-   Wait... what's the YAML acronym?

    -   Originally: "Yet Another Markup Language"

    -   Later: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

-   Set global manuscript options with key-value pairs

## **Code**

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: true
library(dplyr)
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mpg), .groups = "drop")
```

## **Text**

``` markdown
# Heading 1
This is a sentence with some **bold text**, 
some *italic text* and 
an [image](image.png).
```
